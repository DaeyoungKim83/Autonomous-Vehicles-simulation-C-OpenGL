# Autonomous-Vehicles-simulation-C-OpenGL
This repository contains code written in C++ that I developed while working at New York University Control and Networks Lab as a Graduate Assistant. The project to which these codes belong is called: "Steering Control for Autonomous Vehicles with Human-in-the-Loop", and simulate the trajectory of the connected vehicles using the library OpenGL.
